# CrackmeSolutions
Hey you may know me from YouTube you may not. Anyway, these are my various solutions to crackmes I've solved. I'm not the best programmer so my solutions might (will) be pretty ugly but they work! If anything doesn't make sense, if a solution doesn't work for you, or if you just want to chat feel free to reach out to me!

I provide the actual crackme that I solved along with the solution in every crackme directory.
In addition to the solutions I also provide my "pseudo.c" files where I "decompile" the binary back to C like syntax. This code isn't meant to be ready to be compiled but probably could be compiled with minimal effort.
